📊 Task 1: Predictive Modeling (Regression)
Intern Name: Vishal Ramkumar Rajbhar
Intern ID: CV/A1/18203
Domain: Data Science
Program: Code Veda Intermediate Internship

📝 Task Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating regression models to predict a continuous variable, specifically median house values. The task demonstrates the end-to-end implementation of machine learning models using Python and standard libraries.

🎯 Objectives
Perform data preprocessing and train-test splitting.

Develop a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.

Build and evaluate models using Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor.

Measure and compare model performance using appropriate regression metrics.

Visualize model predictions against actual values to assess accuracy and fit.

📁 Dataset
Dataset Used: California Housing Dataset

Source: sklearn.datasets

This dataset includes features such as median income, house age, and population, and the target variable is the median house value for California districts.

🧪 Algorithms Implemented
Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

📈 Evaluation Metrics
R² Score (Coefficient of Determination): Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable predictable from the independent variables.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
